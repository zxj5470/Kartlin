It is a joke project.

## First step (Dart part)
- [ ] Read Dart SDK as Kotlin module . (like an *.knm for Kotlin Native)
Dart grammars:

## Then (Kotlin part)
- [ ] generate and custom with Kotlin DSL grammar
- [ ] write a gradle plugin to compile Kotlin to Dart OR just write an intellij plugin to apply it.
