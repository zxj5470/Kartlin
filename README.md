# Kartlin
It is a joke project, which aims to transform Kotlin code into Dart code 
and I won't finish it.

## First step (Dart part)
- [ ] Read Dart Language Server Protocol API
- [ ] transform Dart SDK API into Kotlin packages/classes/functions. (like an *.knm in Kotlin Native)

### Dart grammars:
- [ ] TODO

## Then (Kotlin part)
- [ ] generate and custom with Kotlin DSL grammar

### Kotlin DSL grammars:
- [ ] TODO

## Plugin
- [ ] write a gradle plugin to compile Kotlin to Dart OR just write an intellij plugin to apply it.
